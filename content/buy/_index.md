We are excited to announce the release of our first book. It focuses on the traits that are important to individual analytics professionals. We both felt that most analytics books concentrate on the organization or more experienced analytics professionals. We think our book is the perfect manual for anyone starting in the field or who wants to level up their analytics game.
